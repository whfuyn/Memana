# Memana
An implementation of various memory management algorithms(first/next/best/worst fit).
It's an assignment in my operating system class. Implementing those algorithms and comparing its performance.
There is a description of the problem, but it's in chinese. Also the code are well-documented in chinese. 
I worte so many comments for my professor's reading, but he didn't spend much time in it. I'm really disappointed. :(

## Usage
The running results are just some plain numbers showing the time each algorithm used to solve the given problem.
There is a data genertor written in python. Run it and you can get a new data file.
```shell
make all
./first
./next
./best
./worst
```
